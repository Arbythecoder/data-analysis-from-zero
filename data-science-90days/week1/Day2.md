### 📅 **Day 2: Lists, Loops & Input**

#### 🎯 Goals

* Work with multiple data items (lists)
* Loop over lists
* Use `input()` to make your program interactive

---

#### 🧠 What is a List?

> A list is like a shopping list — it holds multiple values.

```python
fruits = ["banana", "apple", "mango"]
```

#### 🔄 What is a Loop?

> Loops let us repeat actions — e.g., print each fruit:

```python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

#### 🧍 What is `input()`?

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you,", name)
```

---

#### ✅ Practice

* Create a list of 5 cities
* Ask user for their name and greet them
* Loop over the cities and print them
