### 📅 **Day 1: What is Data Science + Python Setup + Variables**

#### 🎯 Goals

* Understand what data science is (in simple terms)
* Install Python and your code editor
* Learn Python variables and basic data types

#### 🧠 What is Data Science?

> Data Science is how we collect, clean, understand, and make predictions from data using tools like Python, statistics, and business knowledge.

#### 👀 Real-life Examples

* Netflix recommending movies? That's data science.
* Banks checking for fraud? Data science.

#### 🧰 Tools You Need (for Any Device)

| Tool         | Why You Need It                        | Download/Use                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python       | The actual programming language        | [python.org](https://python.org)                               |
| VS Code      | A popular code editor for desktop      | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)         |
| JupyterLab   | Notebook-style coding (easy for data)  | Comes with Anaconda or install via `pip`                       |
| Google Colab | Cloud-based notebook (for mobile too!) | [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) |

#### 🖥️ Python Installation Steps (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1. Go to [https://python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download latest version for your OS
3. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If you see something like `Python 3.12.2`, it’s working!

#### 🔤 Python Variables — What Are They?

> Variables are like labeled boxes where you store data (numbers, words, etc.)

```python
# Assigning values to variables
name = "Grace"
age = 25
height = 5.7
```

#### ✅ Practice

* Create variables for your name, age, favorite color
* Print them using `print()`

```python
print("Hello, my name is", name)
```
